              <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
              <h3>Welcome to Eberron</h3>
              <p>
<b>Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil</b>, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence.<br>
Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the <b>Last War</b> still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body.<br><br>

102 years ago the <b>Kingdom of Galifar</b> fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured.<br>
Their leaders - the Children of the late <b>King Jarot</b> - battled for ultimate control.<br><br>

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down.<br>
Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands.<br>
Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.<br><br>

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape.<br>
Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their <b>dragonmarks</b>, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time.<br><br>

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the <b>Warforged</b>, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them.<br>
Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.<br><br>

With no end in sight, the war raged on.<br>
The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken.<br>
<b>House Cannith</b> became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.<br><br>

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the <b>Day of Mourning</b>.<br>
The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside.<br>
To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility.<br><br>

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations.<br>
Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.<br><br>

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom.
Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge.
No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it.
Only one thing is for certain: <b>something grave</b> is on the horizon.<br><br>
Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps <b>forever</b>.<br><br>

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities.<br>
No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the <b>City of Towers</b>.<br><br>

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete.<br>
A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.<br><br>

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour.<br><br>
Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

              <h3 class="drop-down" data-target="bjorn-heroes"><span class="drop-arrow">&#10146;</span> Bjorn "Bear Wolf" Ulfr</h3>
              <p class="hidden-drop-down" id="bjorn-heroes">
Bjorn-Ulfr was born into the Goliath tribe known as the <b>Stormpeak Clan</b>, a hardy and fierce group that roamed the rugged mountains of the northern lands.<br><br>

From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe.
His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a <b>natural leader</b>.<br><br>

As he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the <b>chieftain</b> of the Stormpeak Clan.<br><br>

Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness.
Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of <b>honor and loyalty</b> was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of <b>unity</b> among his tribe.<br><br>

Bjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, <b>Hrothgar</b>, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling.
As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew.
He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan.<br><br>

Hrothgar's <b>jealousy</b> festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.<br><br>

One fateful night, Hrothgar <b>betrayed</b> his brother, orchestrating a coup against Bjorn-Ulfr and seizing control of the clan through <b>treachery and deceit</b>.
Bjorn-Ulfr, who had always been trusting and believed in the inherent goodness of his people, was taken by surprise.<br><br>

Defeated and cast out by his own brother, Bjorn-Ulfr was left to wander the harsh wilderness <b>alone</b>.<br><br>

With the betrayal still fresh in his heart, Bjorn-Ulfr embarked on a path of <b>self-discovery</b> and <b>redemption</b>.
He channeled his <b>anger</b>, <b>pain</b>, and <b>loss</b> into becoming an even more formidable warrior, 
delving into the ways of the <b>barbarian</b> to hone his rage. As he roamed the wild, 
he formed new alliances and built a following of loyal outcasts and like-minded individuals who sought justice and vengeance against the treacherous Hrothgar.<br><br>

Bjorn-Ulfr's ultimate goal became to confront his brother and restore the <b>rightful order</b> within the Stormpeak Clan.
The memory of the betrayal fueled his <b>determination</b> to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people.<br><br>
Under Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership, his ragtag group of followers would stop at nothing to right the wrongs committed by his own flesh and blood and restore his place as the true <b>chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan</b>.<br>

              <h3 class="drop-down" data-target="draven-heroes"><span class="drop-arrow">&#10146;</span> Draven Flameforge</h3>
              <p class="hidden-drop-down" id="draven-heroes">
Draven Flameforge was born into the proud and ancient clan of Flameforge, a lineage of dragonborn warriors renowned for their devotion to <b>Siberys, the Dragon Above</b>.<br><br>
From an early age, Draven's destiny seemed clear. He was marked with the innate power of draconic blood in his veins, 
and his family recognized his potential to become a great champion of justice and protector of the weak.<br><br>

Raised in the remote mountains, Draven grew up surrounded by the teachings of his <b>clan</b>.
He was trained in the art of combat, his every move guided by the principles of honor, loyalty, and righteousness.<br><br>

His mentor, an elderly paladin named <b>Varyn the Valiant</b>, recognized Draven's exceptional dedication and took him under his wing.
Varyn honed Draven's skills as a <b>warrior</b> and instilled in him the importance of upholding the <b>tenets of Siberys</b>.<br><br>

As Draven matured, he became increasingly aware of the growing <b>darkness</b> plaguing the world. 
Tales of evil forces spreading corruption and chaos deeply troubled him, and he felt a calling to stand against them.<br><br>

Driven by his unwavering faith and the desire to <b>protect the innocent</b>, Draven pledged himself to the service of Siberys as a <b>paladin</b>.
Embarking on his quest, Draven left his clan and set forth into the wider world.<br><br>

He traveled to distant lands, seeking to combat evil and bring justice to those who had been wronged.
Along his journey, he encountered various threats, both mortal and supernatural, and faced numerous challenges that tested his resolve and strengthened his faith.
Draven's draconic heritage played a significant role in his path.<br><br>

He embraced his lineage, seeing it as a gift bestowed upon him by Siberys himself. He learned to harness his dragonborn abilities, 
channeling the elemental power of <b>lightning</b> into his strikes, using his breath weapon as a devastating tool against his enemies.<br><br>

Driven by a deep sense of duty, <b>Draven Flameforge</b> became a <b>beacon of hope</b> in an ever-darkening world.<br><br>

He fought valiantly against the forces of darkness, vanquishing wicked creatures, thwarting diabolical plots, and defending the innocent.
His unwavering commitment to justice and his dedication to the teachings of Siberys made him a respected figure among paladins and a symbol of hope for those in need.<br><br>

As Draven Flameforge's legend grew, his name became synonymous with <b>righteousness and valor</b>.<br><br>

He continued to roam the land, his flaming sword shining brightly, a testament to his unwavering resolve.
Whether battling against vile necromancers, protecting villages from marauding monsters, or leading righteous armies into battle, 
<b>Draven Flameforge</b> remained a steadfast guardian of the weak and a relentless champion of good in a world that sorely needed it.<br>

              <p class="hidden-drop-down" id="sylas-heroes">
Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance.
His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic.
Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly, and it was from her that Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.<br><br>

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will.
His father, though concerned about his son's choices, could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic.
Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.<br><br>

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic <b>Traveler</b><br><br>
The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims.
The Traveler's motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.<br><br>

The Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate.<br>
But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often <i>[text ends abruptly]</i>.

              <h2>SHARN INQUISITOR</h2>
              <h3 class="drop-down" data-target="newspaper1"><span class="drop-arrow" id="newspaper1Arrow">&#10146;</span> Historic Treaty of Thronehold Ushers In New Era of Peace</h3>
              <p class="hidden-drop-down" id="newspaper1">
The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed.<br><br>
This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.<br><br>

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power.
Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities.<br><br>

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy.
These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.<br><br>

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth.
This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.<br><br>

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire.
This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.<br><br>

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved.<br><br>
Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization.
Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.<br><br>

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.<br><br>

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity.
It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.<br>

              <p class="hidden-drop-down" id="newspaper2">
In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the Eldeen Reaches.<br>
The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of Sharn, casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.<br><br>

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in Morgrave University's hallowed halls.<br>
Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.<br><br>

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest.<br>
Some members of the Aurum have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol.<br>
Meanwhile, House Vadalis, bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.<br><br>

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery.<br>
As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.<br>

                  More a myth than a fact of life, the prophecy isn't a document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. 
                  Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge. That's the myth, at least.
